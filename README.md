# Movie-app
This Movie App is built with Laravel 7, Tailwind CSS, and The Movie DB REST API to display movie details dynamically. It leverages Laravel's HTTP Client for API requests and Blade Components for reusable UI elements. Tailwind CSS is used for modern styling with CSS Grid and Transitions. The project explores different Laravel/Vue architecture options within the ecosystem.
